AXML
====

AXML is a library designed to parse binary Android XML files (ie : XML files compressed by the Android AAPT tool). This library was first designed to be used inside the Axel app, available on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fr.xgouchet.xmleditor) and [GitHub](https://github.com/xgouchet/Axel). 

[![Release](https://jitpack.io/v/xgouchet/AXML.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#xgouchet/AXML)

LINK
=====

To add this library to your build, add the following line to your project's gradle : 

    allprojects {
		repositories {
			...
			maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
		}
	}
	
Then you can just add the dependency like that : 

	dependencies {
		compile 'com.github.bluemods:AXML:1.1'
	}

USAGE
===== 

You can use the parser either as Sax or Dom. 

The following code requires an implementation of the CompressedXmlParserListener interface (which is quite similar to a SaxListener interface) : 

```java
File file = ... 
CompressedXmlParserListener listener = ...
new CompressedXmlParser().parse(new FileInputStream(file), listener);
```

The following code will return the root of a DOM tree : 

```java
File file = ... 
Document doc = new CompressedXmlParser().parseDOM(new FileInputStream(file));
```
